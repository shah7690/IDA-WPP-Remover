## üìö Overview

The **IDA WPP Remover** is a plugin designed to assist security researchers and reverse engineers in removing WPP (Windows Driver Kit Trace Preprocessor) calls from Hex-Rays decompiled code. This tool simplifies the process of cleaning up decompiled outputs, allowing users to focus on more critical analysis without the clutter of unnecessary preprocessor calls.

## üöÄ Features

- **Simplified Process**: Removes WPP calls automatically, saving time and effort.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed with a straightforward interface for ease of use.
- **Compatible**: Works seamlessly with Hex-Rays decompiler and IDA Pro.
- **Extensible**: Built on IDAPython, making it easy to modify for your specific needs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have IDA Pro installed with Hex-Rays decompiler.
- Python 3.x must be installed for IDAPython support.

### Steps to Install

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/shah7690/IDA-WPP-Remover/releases).
2. Extract the contents of the downloaded file.
3. Copy the plugin files to your IDA Pro plugin directory (usually located in the `plugins` folder of your IDA installation).
4. Restart IDA Pro to load the new plugin.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

1. Open a binary file in IDA Pro.
2. Navigate to the Hex-Rays view.
3. Click on the **Plugins** menu.
4. Select **WPP Remover**.
5. The plugin will scan the code and remove any WPP calls it finds.

### Example

Here‚Äôs an example of how the plugin works. 

Before:
```c
WPP_INIT_TRACING(DriverName);
```

After:
```c
// WPP call removed
```

The output is cleaner, making it easier to read and analyze the decompiled code.
